        <h1 className="exercises-workouts-heading">Cardio</h1>
        <p>Cardiovascular workouts are unique and differ from other workouts. Although you can combine multiple exercises of cardio into one workout, you don't necessarily need too. Your cardio can consist of only one exercise, just performed for a longer duration.</p>
        <p className="bold">Below are some examples of some cardio vascular workouts you can do. Choose on that fits your style and give it a try.</p>

    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">1. Walking [300-400 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">Yes, walking! Perhaps the simplest, most available exercise around is walking. Walking is not only a great way to burn calories, but it’s also a low-impact workout so almost anyone can do it.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">2. Running Stairs [1000 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">A simple flight of stairs is about to be your new favorite workout tool. Walking, running, or lunging up a flight of stairs provides a great big calorie burn. A 150-lb person running stairs for an hour can burn 1000 calories! Wow! That’s crazy!!!</p>
    </div>
    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">3. Kettlebells [800-900 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">Kettle-what? Kettlebell! It is a cannonball-shaped weight that produces a powerful, effective workout like you’ve never experienced before! Kettlebell workouts combine strength training with cardio for a complete workout. And if you want a calorie burn, look no further. These babies can help you burn up to 20 calories per minute, which is the equivalent to running a 6-minute mile. Now that’s called getting the most from your workout time!</p>
    </div>
    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">4. Jumping Rope [600 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">One of the best cardio exercises for weight loss is jumping rope! It’s not only a calorie blaster but helps build bone density, strengthens your legs and makes your heart stronger. According to WebMd you’d have to run an eight-minute mile to work off more calories than you can burn jumping rope</p>
    </div>
    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">5. HIIT [600 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">HIIT, or “High Intensity Interval Training,” has grown by leaps and bounds over the last several years. What was once used to train only elite athletes is now mainstream and can be found in any gym and all over in online workouts! High intensity interval training comes in many forms, but the goal remains the same: go all-out with your highest intensity for a short interval, then take a brief recovery and do it again.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="workouts">
      <h3 className="workout-exercise-name">6. Cycling [600 calories/hour]</h3>
      <p className="workout-exercise-description">Remember when you were a kid and riding your bike was the best part of the day? Hop back on that bike and start peddling! Cycling is an excellent way to get exercise, increase your heart health, strengthen your leg muscles and burn some serious calories. Outdoor cycling is fantastic and fills your need for fresh air and vitamin D. But not everyone feels comfortable biking outside or has the money to purchase a brand new bike (that one with the banana seat from 1974 might not work any more). In that case, let me introduce you to the notion of indoor cycling!</p>
